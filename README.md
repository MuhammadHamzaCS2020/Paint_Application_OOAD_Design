# Paint_Application_OOAD_Design
Paint Type Application with OOAD Design's  
It is a Paint type Application for Different Shape's.
Basically, The Purpose of This Application to Understand the Some OOAD Design Patterns and 
Also the Swing Frame work of Java for GUI..

Design Pattern's that use in this Application

i) Strategy and State Pattern:
      Add menus to the frame (see the image below), and based on user's input, you'll have to save the drawings as a text, binary, or image file. Since the logic/algorithm to save as each type shall be different, you should use Strategy pattern to encapsulate those algorithms.
      
ii) Factory: 
      Instantiation of each concrete strategy is dependent on the user input. Implement a Factory Method to encapsulate the task of strategy creation.
      
iii) Singleton: 
      There should not be more than one Factory object in the program.
